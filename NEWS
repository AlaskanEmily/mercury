NEWS for Mercury release 0.6
----------------------------

* XXX higher_order

* XXX unused_args

* XXX dead_proc_elim

* We have renamed the varset__lookup predicates to varset__search in order to
  conform to our general naming convention.

* Various other minor improvements:
  - The code generator now emits better code for constructing deep
    nonground terms.
  - Value numbering is now invoked even on code sequences containing several
    heap allocations.
