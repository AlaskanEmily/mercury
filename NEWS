NEWS for Mercury release 0.4
----------------------------

Higher-order predicates and lambda expressions are now implemented.
(This means that `call/{1,2,3}' and `solutions/2' are now usable;
unfortunately call/{4,5,6,...} are still not yet implemented.)
Unique modes are now partially implemented (but don't use them
for anything except I/O, as the implementation is not yet complete).
Partially instantiated modes are now closer to being fully implemented.
The installation process is more standard (configure; make; make install).
Autoconfiguration is a bit more robust.
`msc' and `mnc' now produce somewhat smaller object files.
Error messages are a little better in some cases.
Fixed a few code generation bugs.
Ported to DEC Alpha/OSF and BSDI BSD/386.
We've improved the efficiency of the 386 port by about 50%
(the asm_fast.gc mode now works on the 386).
We generate better code for calls to `\='.
We generate better code for `compare/3'.
A few other new optimizations.
The profiler now works (documentation is sparse, though - see profiler/README).
Some new library predicates, including `string__format' (like C's sprintf).
`set__join/2' has been renamed as `set__power_union/2'.
`list__sort/2' has been renamed as `list__sort_and_remove_dups/2'.
There is a new `list__sort/2' which does not remove duplicates.
