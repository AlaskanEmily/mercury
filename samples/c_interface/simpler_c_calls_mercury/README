This directory contains an example program with a C main() function
where C calls Mercury.

This interface is simpler than having a Mercury main/2 call a c_main()
function which then calls back Mercury.  However, it is still not
quite general enough -- we really ought to have MR_init_mercury() and
MR_shutdown_mercury() functions to initialize and shutdown the Mercury
Runtime engine, rather than the existing interface via mercury_main().

So, the interface shown here should be considered as likely to
change in future releases.
