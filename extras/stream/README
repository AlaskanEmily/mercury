This directory contains various instances of the stream typeclass defined
in the Mercury standard library.  The instances implement various utility
streams.

stream_util.m:
	The top-level package.

stream_util.string_builder.m:
	An output stream that can be used to build up strings from predicates
	that write to any string or character streams.

tests/:
	Some test cases.  To run the tests, change to this directory and
	type "make".

lowlevel.m:
impure.m:
stream_old.m:
	These files are part of the old stream interface, which has now been
	deprecated.

	Similar functionality is available in the standard library's            
	stream module.

	To build the stream_old library do "mmake old_stream".
