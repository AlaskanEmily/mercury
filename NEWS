NEWS since Mercury release 0.8:
-------------------------------

* We've added a new predicate to the Mercury standard library:
	bag__count_value/3.	

* The extras distribution now includes support for dynamic linking.

  The interface is based on the C functions dlopen(), dlsym(), and co.,
  which are supported by most modern Unix systems.
  See the files in extras/dynamic_linking for details.
