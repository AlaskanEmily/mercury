The Mercury test suite is (dis)organized into the following subdirectories.
To run the tests in a particular subdirectory, cd to that directory
and then do `mmake depend; mmake check'.

benchmarks
	This directory contains Mercury versions of the benchmarks.
	These tests work by comparing the output of the Mercury and
	the NU-Prolog versions.
	These tests are run automatically on a regular basis.

general
	This directory is for general test cases.
	(It might be a good idea to split this into tests
	of particular features and regression tests that check
	for old bugs.  But for the moment, just about everything
	goes in here.)
	These tests work by comparing the output of the Mercury and
	the NU-Prolog versions.
	These tests are run automatically on a regular basis.

hard_coded
	This directory is for tests of features that don't work in
	NU-Prolog.  The expected output of the program has to be
	hard-coded in a hand-written `.exp' file, rather having the
	`.exp' file be generated automatically using NU-Prolog.
	These tests are run automatically on a regular basis.

valid
	This directory is for test cases that are not complete
	programs.  `mmake check' just checks that the files compile.
	***These tests are not yet run automatically.***

invalid
	This directory is for test cases that are invalid
	programs.  `mmake check' should check that the files do
	not compile - but automation of this is not yet implemented.
	***These tests are not yet run automatically.***
