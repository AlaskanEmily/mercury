This directory contains the package `mercury_glut'
which is a Mercury binding to the GL utility toolkit (GLUT).

GLUT provides a (relatively) platform independent API for
writing OpenGL applications.  It provides most of the system
dependent bits, such as window management, that the OpenGL API doesn't.

See <http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut.html> for further 
details.

The Mmakefile includes instructions for building and installing the
library on Linux based systems.  Users of MacOS X, should instead see
the file Mmakefile.MacOSX for instructions on how to build the binding.
