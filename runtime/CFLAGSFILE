# Use these options for optimizing compiles with gcc
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DSPEED

# Use this with gcc if you want to look at the .s files
# -fverbose-asm
# (and add -mrnames for mips register names, if you want)

# use to preserve the cpp output with gcc
# -save-temps

# use to debug gcc's flow analysis
# -dr -df -ds

# Use these options for debugging compiles
# -g 

# Use this option if you want to use timing.c's built-in timer.
# Disable the option if you want to time the program externally,
# since invoking the built-in timer many times can significantly
# distort the results otherwise.
# -DOWNTIMER

# Use this option only with gcc
# Currently only supported for mips and sparc cpus.
-DUSE_GCC_GLOBAL_REGISTERS

# Use this option only with gcc.
# If you enable this option, you must ensure that MOD2CFLAGSFILE contains -g.
# If you disable this option, you must ensure that it doesn't contains -g.
-DUSE_GCC_NONLOCAL_GOTOS

# Enable this option if you want to measure the number of times
# each register is used.  Note that the measurement includes
# uses which occur inside debugging routines, so to get an accurate
# count you need to disable all the debugging routines by compiling
# with -DSPEED and not using any -d* flags.
