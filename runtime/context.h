** context.h - defines Mercury multithreading stuff.
**
** A Context is like a thread. It contains a detstack, a nondetstack,
** the various pointers that refer to them, a succip, and a thread-
** resumption continuation. Contexts are initally stored in a free-list.
** When one is running, the Unix process that is executing it has a pointer
** to its context structure `this_context'. When a context suspends, it
** calls `save_context(context_ptr)' which copies the context from the
** various registers and global variables into the structure refered to
** by `context_ptr'. The context contains no rN or fN registers - all
** registers are "context save" (by analogy to caller-save).
**
** When a new context is created information is passed to the new context
** on the stack. The top stackframe of the current context is copied to
** become the first det stackframe in the new process. (XXX this will need
** fixing eventually to include the nondet frame as well.)
**
** Threads can migrate transparently between multiple Unix processes.
** This is implicit since all the state of the thread is allocated in
** shared memory, and all the heaps are also in shared memory.
**
** Each Unix process has its own heap and solutions heap (both allocated
** in shared memory). This makes GC harder, but enables heap allocation
** to be done without locking.
** Each context has a copy of the heap pointer that is taken when it is
** switched out. If the Unix process' heap pointer is the same as the
** copied one when the context is switched back in, then it is safe for
** the context to do heap reclamation on failure.
**
** If PARALLEL is not defined, then everything gets executed within a
** single Unix process. No locking is required. No shared memory is
** required. Since there is only one process, no signalling is needed
** to wake suspended processes.

**
** If hp < context_hp, then another context has truncated the heap on failure.

** that other context was the last one to allocate data on the heap, and we
** did not allocate any heap during that period of execution. That being the

** the current value of hp is the same as some previous value that we held,
** and we are now contiguous with our older data, so this algorithm will lead
** to holes in the heap, though GC will reclaim these.
