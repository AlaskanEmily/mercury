This directory contains the package `mercury_opengl', which is a Mercury
binding for OpenGL  and the package `mtogl' which is a tk widget for 
creating and managing OpenGL rendering contexts.

For `mercury_opengl', you will need:
	- the Mercury system
	- an OpenGL implementation such as Mesa.

In order to use it you will also need some way for your program to
create and manage rendering contexts (mtogl is one such way).

For `mtogl' you will need:
	- the Mercury system.
	- Tcl/Tk (Tk 4.0 or later)
	- the `mercury_tcltk' package

NOTES:
	- You must link `mtogl' against the same version of Tcl/Tk as the
	  `mercury_tcltk' package.
	- mtogl will probably not work versions of Tcl/Tk greater than 8.0.

This directory contains the following modules.
	
	mglu.m	- provides Mercury bindings to (some of) the GLU library.
	mogl.m	- provides Mercury bindings to (some of) Open GL 1.1
	mtogl.m	- provides a Mercury binding to Togl, a
			  tcl/tk OpenGL widget.
	
	togl.c, togl.h  - Togl 1.5

	other .c and .h - Internals of Tk.
	files

See the file Mmakefile for instructions on how to build the OpenGL binding.
The file Mmakefile.MacOSX contains instructions on how to build the binding
on systems with MacOS X.
The file Mmakefile.mtogl contains instructions on how to build mtogl.

See HOWTO for details on how to link the package in with your own
Mercury programs.
