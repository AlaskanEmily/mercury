	How to upgrade to a new version of Boehm Garbage Collector in Mercury.
</H1>

<P>
<B>WARNING:</B> This process is difficult and should not be undertaken lightly.
Before attempting to upgrade Boehm GC one should definitely discuss it on
the reviews mailing list first.
</P>

<h2>
The setup
</h2>

<p>
This is the first attempt to update Boehm since Mercury switched from CVS to
Git.
Therefore, I've taken the opportunity to setup this process in a more
git-ish way (Boehm GC also uses git).
I set this up for for version 7.4.2 of the collector and libatomic_ops.
</p>

<p>
Over time we've made some changes to the collector, some of which have not
been pushed upstream.
The changes that have not been pushed upstream must be managed by us.
I've forked the bdwgc and libatomic_opts repositories.
Our forks are currently located here:
</p>

<p>
XXX: Once this is confirmed move these repositories to the MercuryLang
Github organisation.
</p>

<p>
On a clean checkout of the Mercury repository,
I created a branch off of the master branch.
</p>

<code><pre>
$ git branch upgrade_boehm master
$ git checkout upgrade_boehm
</pre></code>

<p>
Then, on this branch I deleted the existing boehm_gc directory from the
repository.
</p>

<code><pre>
$ rm -rf boehm_gc
$ git commit -a
</pre></code>

<p>
Next we add the bdwgc and libatomic_ops repositories as git submodules.
This basically creates a reference from the Mercury repository to these
other repositories without importing their history into the Mercury
repository.
</p>
<p>
The references to submodules are relative.  So if the remote named origin
has the url
<code>https://www.github.com/PaulBone/mercury.git</code>
then we can have git look for the bdwgc repository at the relative path
<code>../bdwgc.git</code> or
<code>https://www.github.com/PaulBone/bdwgc.git</code>.
</p>

<code><pre>
$ git submodule add -b release-7_4-mercury ../bdwgc.git boehm_gc
$ git submodule add -b release-7_4-mercury ../libatomic_ops.git libatomic_ops
</pre></code>

<p>
I've written a script named <code>prepare.sh</code> and committed it, it can
be used to initialize and checkout the submodules.
</p>

<h2>Mercury's customisations to the Boehm GC</h2>

<p>
I've created a branch named <code>mercury7_2</code>
based on the <code>gc7_2</code> tag in the bdwgc repository.
This branch contains the Mercury customisations to boehm_gc as a series of
patches.
Then to upgrade to 7.4.2 I created a new branch <code>release-7_4-mercury</code>
(from <code>mercury7_2</code>),
switched to it, and rebased it onto the point in the boehm_gc tree that
represents the BDWGC 7.4.2 release, that is the tag <code>gc7_4_2</code>:
</p>

<code><pre>
$ git branch release-7_4-mercury mercury7_2
$ git checkout release-7_4-mercury
$ git rebase --onto gc7_4_2 gc7_2
</pre></code>

<p>
I needed to solve several merge conflicts to complete the rebase.
</p>

<h2>Pulling changes from upstream</h2>

<p>
The final step is how to update Mercury's copy of the collector when there
are changes upstream.
At the time of writing there are some important patches on the collector's
<code>release-7_4</code> branch (The TSX bug).
This is done simply creating a new branch and debasing the Mercury project's
customisations onto that branch:
</p>

XXX

<code><pre>
$ git branch mercury7_4_pbone mercury7_4_2
$ git checkout mercury7_4_pbone
$ git rebase --onto release-7_4_pbone gc7_4
</pre></code>

<p>
These changes applied cleanly and I didn't need to resolve any merge
conflicts.
I sometimes find it useful to use vimdiff to help me merge changes, git can
call vimdiff for you.
git can launch a number of different tools depending on your tastes.
</p>

<code><pre>
$ git mergetool --tool=vimdiff
</pre></code>

<p>
You may also need to update the libatomic_ops directory.
</p>

<p>
Now go back to the mercury repository and update the submodule to point to
the new branch
</p>

<code><pre>
$ vim .gitmodules
$ git submodule update --remote
$ git add .gitmodules boehm_gc
$ git commit
</pre></code>

<p>
Once done,
bootcheck the compiler in at least asm_fast.gc and hlc.gc.
Then use the new system to do an install (with non-empty LIBGRADES)
and test that the installed version can compile some test programs.
This is because the update may have added some new files which may not be
copied into the install directories.
Some build scripts may also need to be updated (in particular
tools/bootcheck and scripts/prepare_install_dir.in).
</p>

<p>
Finally update .README.in (in the root directory) and
bindist/bindist.README to reflect the current version of the collector
being used.
Then commit these changes and have the changes reviewed before pushing them
into the public repository.
