NEWS since Mercury release 0.8:
-------------------------------

* We've added a new predicate to the Mercury standard library:
	bag__count_value/3.	

* The extras distribution now includes support for dynamic linking.

  The interface is based on the C functions dlopen(), dlsym(), and co.,
  which are supported by most modern Unix systems.
  See the files in extras/dynamic_linking for details.

* The debugger now includes support for interactive queries.

  See the "Interactive query commands" subsection of the "Debugger commands"
  section of the "Debugging" chapter of the Mercury User's Guide for details.

* We've removed the support for using a Prolog debugger on Mercury programs.

  Now that we have a working Mercury debugger, there's no longer any need to
  use a Prolog debugger for debugging Mercury code.

  Normally we would warn at least one or two releases in advance, if
  any feature is to be removed.  However, in this case

  	- it was an implementation feature rather than a language feature;
	- the cost of maintaining the feature was quite high;
	- the feature was already broken is various ways [one being that it
	  doesn't work with the latest versions of SICStus Prolog, due to
	  those versions removing support for a SICStus Prolog feature
	  (save/1), apparently without any advance notice]; and
	- a simple work-around is available if anything breaks as a result
	  of the feature being removed. 

  In the unlikely event that anyone happened to have any makefiles or
  scripts that depended on the support for using Prolog, they can
  install the latest Mercury distribution and still continue to use the
  Prolog support from Mercury 0.8, just by including the `bin'
  directories for both versions in their PATH, with the more recent one
  first, of course.
