The Mercury implementation is free software, but it is Copyright (C)
1994-1997 The University of Melbourne.  It is distributed under the terms
of the GNU General Public License.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.  The Mercury library and runtime (the files in the library
and runtime subdirectories) are distributed under the terms of the GNU
Library General Public License.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying
permissions for those files.  (If those licencing arrangements are not
satisfactory, please contact us!  We are willing to offer alternative
arrangements, if the need should arise.)  The subdirectory `boehm_gc'
contains a conservative garbage collector distributed by Hans Boehm -
see the file README in that directory for copyright information about
those files.  A few files (config*) are derived from code that is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  The program `texi2html'
in the doc directory is copyright by CERN; see the copyright notice at
the end of that file.  The `Togl' library in extras/graphics/Togl-1.2
is copyright by Brian Paul and Ben Bederson; see the file
extras/graphics/Togl-1.2/LICENCE.

THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  See the file COPYING.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
But first read README.AIX, README.BSDI, README.IRIX-5, README.Linux,
or README.MS-Windows if you are installing on a machine running
AIX, BSD Unix, IRIX 5, Linux, or Microsoft Windows respectively.

The documentation sources are in the `doc' subdirectory.  The installation
process will install INFO, HTML, and DVI versions in the locations specified
in the file Mmake.common - by default these locations are
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/info,
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/html,
and /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/doc respectively.
The installation process will also install Unix-style man pages -
by default they will be installed in /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/man/man1.
The files RELEASE_NOTES, NEWS, HISTORY, LIMITATIONS, and BUGS
also contain useful information.  If you're interested in looking
at the source code, the file compiler/notes/compiler_design.html is
a good place to start.

The `samples' directory contains some example Mercury programs.
There are also some additional Mercury programs and libraries
in the `extras' directory.
