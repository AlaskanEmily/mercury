# Maintenance instructions:
# 
# The sources are stored using CVS. 
# 
# Anytime you commit a .nl file, you need to make sure the corresponding
# .int and .int2 files are up-to-date, and you need to commit them too.
#
# `mercury_compile.nl' and `code_gen.nl' are automatically generated from files
# with a .pp extension.  Make sure you edit the .pp file not the .nl file,
# but when you commit the .pp file, you need to make sure that the .nl file
# is up-to-date and commit that too.
#
# Anytime you add a new .nl file or remove an existing one, you need to
# do a `make Makefile', and you need to also commit `Makefile',
# `mercury_compile.dep', and `library.dep'.
