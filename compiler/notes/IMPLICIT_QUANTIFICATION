Rules for implicit quantification in Mercury
--------------------------------------------

Any variable occurring in a negated context (i.e.  inside a negation,
inside a universal quantification, in the condition of an if-then-else,
or in a disequality), and which does not occur outside of that
negated context other than in "parallel" goals, is implicitly
existentially quantified inside the negation.

"Parallel" goals are defined as follows:  different branches of a
disjunction are parallel; and the "else" part of an if-then-else is
parallel to the condition and then "then" part (and vice versa).

(NB.  The current implementation does not yet handle disequalities
specially, and hence does NOT get implicit quantification right for them.)
