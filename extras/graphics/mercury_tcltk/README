This directory contains the package `mercury_tcltk', which is a Mercury
binding for Tcl/Tk. You will need the Mercury compiler to build
it (see <http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mercury> to find out more about Mercury).
You will also need Tcl/Tk 4.0 or later installed on your system.

It contains the following modules:
	mtcltk.m        - a binding to Tcl/Tk (Tk 4.0 or later)
	mtk.m           - a layer on top of mtcltk making it
			  easier to create and manipulate Tk
			  widgets.

See HOWTO for details on how to link the package in with your own
Mercury programs.
