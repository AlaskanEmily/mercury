This directory contains stuff for doing coroutining with deterministic goals.
See the two example programs:
	philo	- the dining philosophers example
	midimon	- a midi data monitor that concurrently reads the bytestream,
		  parses the MIDI messages, and writes out the results.
		  A file `midi_data' has been included which contains some midi
		  data you can test the program with. MIDI (Musical Instrument
		  Digital Interface) is a hardware and software protocol for
		  electronic musical instruments (eg synthesizers) to talk to
		  each other.
