The Aditi interface and Aditi itself are still in development.
The Aditi system is not yet publicly available.

* aditi__state arguments must currently be ground, not unique. This will
  be fixed when the alias branch is merged in. Use the mode aditi_mui
  defined in aditi.m instead for now.

* Only calls to local, non-recursive Mercury predicates are allowed
  from Aditi procedures (they are generated inline). The code
  generator aborts if recursive predicates are called. Stick
  to builtins in join conditions for now.

* Update predicates for base relations are not yet implemented.
