Installation instructions:

0.  The source will be distributed with the .dep files and Makefile
    already created and up-to-date.  But if you obtained the source
    using `cvs checkout', you will need GNU make and you will need to
    type

	make depend

    When using GNU make, the individual file dependencies are automatically
    generated on the fly, but the above command is necessary so that
    the system can determine which files need to be linked in to produce
    the main executable.

1.  If you don't have GNU make, then type

	make ints

    This is necessary because ordinary make doesn't handle transitive
    dependencies.

2.  Type

	make install

3.  (Optional) 
    Type

	make clean

That's it.
