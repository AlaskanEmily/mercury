The current implementation does not yet completely implement
the Mercury language. The main features which are not yet fully
implemented are

	- partially instantiated modes
	- unique modes
	- module qualifiers

These features are also not yet documented. :-(

When the above features are implemented, we will consider the
implementation to be in some sense "complete", and release version 1.0.
Of course, those are not the only things we're working on.  Amoung
other things, we'd like to provide a much better C interface and a
better garbage collector.  We're also working on a parallel/multithreaded
version of Mercury.
