To install Opium-M, unzip and de-tar the file Opium-M-*.tar.gz, and run the
script INSTALL-OPIUM-M. This will create in the scripts/ directory the
script Opium-M that let you run Opium-M. 

Add directories scripts/ and bin/ in your PATH environment variable. Make sure
that the executables mmc and eclipse are also accessible from your PATH.


The current release of Opium-M has been tested with the following
configurations:
- Architecture: sparc/Solaris2.[5,6,7] and i686/Linux2.0
- ECLiPSe: 4.1 and later (1).
- Mercury: later than 1999-03-12 release of the day.

(1) make sure that the package eclipse_misc.tgz has been downloaded (i.e. if
there exists a directory named `lib_pd' in the ECLiPSe installation directory);
Opium-M needs it.

(*) If you use one of those versions of ECLiPSe, you will need to add the
following line in your .opium-m-rc file (that should be in your home
directory): 
":- set_parameter(socket_domain, [inet])."

This is to work around a bug in ECLiPSe socket interface that has been fixed in
version 4.1.
