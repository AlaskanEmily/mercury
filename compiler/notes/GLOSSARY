HLDS: The "High Level Data Structure".  See hlds.m.

moduleinfo: Another name for the HLDS.

LLDS: The "Low Level Data Structure".  See llds.m.

inst: instantiatedness.  Indicates whether a variable is free, partially
      bound, or ground.

mode: this has two meanings:
	(1) a mapping from one instantiatedness to another
		(the mode of a single variable)
	(2) a mapping from an initial instantiatedness of a predicate's
		arguments to their final instantiatedness
		(the mode of a predicate)
	
proc (procedure): a particular mode of a predicate.

procinfo: the structure in HLDS which contains
	information about a procedure.

predinfo: the structure in HLDS which contains information about
	a predicate.

codeinfo: a structure used by codegen.m

switch: a disjunction which does a case analysis on the toplevel
	functor of some variable.

super-homogenous form (SHF): a simplified, flattened form of goals, where
	each unification is split into its component pieces; in particular,
	the arguments of each predicate call and functor must be distinct
	variables.
