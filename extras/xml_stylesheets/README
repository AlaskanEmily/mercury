This directory contains some example stylesheets for use with the term_to_xml
library module.

You can apply a stylesheet to an XML document using the program xsltproc
(available from http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT) or any other XSLT tool.  You can also
include a reference to the stylesheet in the XML document and have your browser
apply the stylesheet, although this only works with some browsers.
