This directory contains stuff for doing graphics with Mercury.
We have created bindings to Tcl/Tk and OpenGL. Neither are complete,
but both are complete *enough* to be very useful.

If you add missing functionality to any of these modules, let us know,
and we'll see about incorporating enhancements in the main distribution.

It contains the following modules:
	mtcltk.m	- a binding to Tcl/Tk (Tk 4.0 or later)
	mtk.m		- a layer on top of mtcltk making it easier to
			  create and manipulate Tk widgets.
	mogl.m		- a binding to OpenGL
	mglu.m 		- a binding to the GLU library
	mtogl.m		- a binding to the ToGL widget for Tk.

We have included the Togl-1.2 distribution for convenience. See the
LICENSE file in the Togl-1.2 directory.

We have included two sample programs in the samples directory:
	samples/calc	- a calculator that uses the Tcl/Tk and Tk modules.
	samples/maze	- draws pretty mazes in 3D using OpenGL.

We haven't worked out how to prevent the Tcl/Tk library from giving a
tcl prompt when it enters the event loop. If you know how, let us know!
