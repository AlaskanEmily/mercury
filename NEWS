NEWS for Mercury release 0.6
----------------------------

* XXX higher_order

* XXX unused_args

* A new optimization, --optimize-dead-procs, removes unused procedures from
  the generated code. XXX

* The getopt library is now more flexible. It can handle command line switches
  (such as -O2) that affect the values of many options, and it can handle
  long options that specify a value after an equal sign, in the GNU style
  (e.g. --optimization-level=2).

* We have renamed the varset__lookup predicates to varset__search in order to
  conform to our general naming convention.

* Various other minor improvements:

  - You can now use -O <n> to select an optimization level between 0 and 5.

  - You can now use --optimize-space to select optimization for space, instead
    of optimization for time (which is the default).

  - The code generator now emits better code for constructing deep
    nonground terms.

  - Value numbering now processes even code sequences containing several
    heap allocations.

  - --pred-value-number now works. If it is given, and value numbering notices
    that a value is available from a location that is faster to access than the
    one from which another code sequence retrieves the value, this other code
    sequence will be reoptimized taking this into account.
