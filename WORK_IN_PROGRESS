Work in progress
----------------

The compiler contains some code for the following features,
which are not yet completed:

* There is a new `--generate-bytecode' option --
  but the bytecode interpreter isn't working yet.

* There is a new `--generate-prolog' option
  which does not work yet.

* There is a new `--optimize-constructor-last-call' option
  which identifies opportunities for LCO where a call
  is followed only by some constructor invocations.
  However, these opportunities are not exploited yet.

* We now allow programmers to give names to the arguments of constructor
  function symbols.  (Disabled, due to lack of a suitable operator.)


We also have some code that goes at least some part of the way towards
implementing the features below.   However, for these features, the
code has not yet been committed and thus is not part of the standard
distribution.

* Tabling/memoing of det and semidet predicates.

* Support for Haskell-style type classes.

* Termination analysis. The paper describing our algorithm and results
  is available from our Web page; a shorter version will be published
  in the Static Analysis Symposium.

* Support for heap profiling.
