# Maintenance instructions:
# 
# The sources are stored using CVS. 
# 
# Anytime you commit a .nl file, you need to make sure the corresponding
# .int and .int2 files are up-to-date, and you need to commit them too.
#
# Anytime you add a new .nl file or remove an existing one, you need to
# do a `make depend', and you need to also commit `Makefile',
# `mercury_compile.dep', and `library.dep'.
