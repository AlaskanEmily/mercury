This directory contains stuff for doing graphics with Mercury.
We have created bindings to Tcl/Tk and OpenGL. Neither are complete,
but both are complete *enough* to be very useful.

If you add missing functionality to any of these modules, let us know,
and we'll see about incorporating enhancements in the main distribution.

	mercury_tcltk/		A Mercury binding to Tcl/Tk.

	mercury_opengl/		A Mercury binding to OpenGL.  This 
                                directory also contains `mtogl' which
                                is a Mercury binding to Togl, a Tk widget
                                for OpenGL.
	
	mercury_glut/		A Mercury binding to GLUT.
					
	samples/
		calc/		A calculator that uses mercury_tcltk

		maze/		Draws pretty mazes in 3D using OpenGL
				and Togl.

		pent/		Places pentominoes on a board in 3D 
				using OpenGL and Togl.

We haven't worked out how to prevent the Tcl/Tk library from giving a
tcl prompt when it enters the event loop. If you know how, let us know!
