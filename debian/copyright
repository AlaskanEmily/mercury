This package was first debianized by Milan Zamazal <pdm@fi.muni.cz> on
Tue, 4 Mar 1997 16:01:10 +0100.

Subsequent debianizations have been performed by Tyson Dowd
<trd@cs.mu.oz.au>.

The sources for this package were obtained from the Mercury CVS archive,
but are the same sources as mercury-<VERSION>-compiler.tar.gz from
<ftp://ftp.mercury.cs.mu.oz.au/pub/mercury>.
The only difference is that the tar file contains pre-compiled .c files
to make bootstrapping easier.

This means if you want to recompile this package, you need to have
a working Mercury compiler already installed (not to mention a working
C compiler and other tools).  This can be done by installing the
Debian binary package, or installing the compiler from the tar file
shown above (however see README.Debian for updates to this procedure).
