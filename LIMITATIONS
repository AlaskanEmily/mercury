The current implementation does not yet completely implement
the Mercury language. The features which are not yet fully
implemented are

	- higher order predicates and lambda closures
	- partially instantiated modes
	- unique modes
	- module qualifiers

These features are also not yet documented. :-(

We'd also like to provide a much better C interface and
a better garbage collector.
