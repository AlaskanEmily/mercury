To create a binary distribution on Windows 95 or Windows NT:

	- first install from the source distribution (see ../README.MS-Windows)

	- s/mdemangle/mdemangle.exe/ and s/mkinit/mkinit.exe/
	  and s/info_to_mdb/info_to_mdb.exe/
	  in bindist/Mmakefile and bindist/bindist.Makefile.in

	- then just do `mmake bindist' in the bindist directory
