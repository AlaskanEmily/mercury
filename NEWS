NEWS for Mercury release 0.5
----------------------------

* We now support shared libraries for IRIX 5.
* We now allow the use of compilers other than gcc -
  see the user's guide for details.
  We don't recommend the use of compilers other than gcc,
  since the inability to use gcc's special features will
  most likely lead to much less efficient code.
* In portable C mode, we now generate better code for loops.
* We've made a few other minor improvements in the generated code.
* Unary plus and minus are now implemented.
* Corrected a lot of typos in the documentation.
* Fixed quite a few bugs.
