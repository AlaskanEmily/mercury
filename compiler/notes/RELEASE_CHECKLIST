This file contains a checklist of the steps that must be
taken when releasing a new version of Mercury.

1.  Update the version number in
	README
	INSTALL (various places)
	Mmake
	bindist/Mmake
	configure.in
	library/library.m
    and update the NEWS, RELEASE_NOTES, and HISTORY files. 
    The RELEASE_NOTES file should include the contents of the NEWS file.
    The HISTORY file should include the NEWS files from previous releases.

2.  Checkout a fresh copy, and do

	touch Mmake.params &&
	autoconf &&
	mercury_cv_low_tag_bits=2 \
	mercury_cv_bits_per_word=32 \
	mercury_cv_unboxed_floats=no \
	sh configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR &&
	mmake MMAKEFLAGS='EXTRA_MCFLAGS="-O5 --opt-space" -j6' tar

    This step should be done automatically by tools/test_mercury every night,
    so you should be able to just grab the mercury-latest-stable.tar.gz
    file from /home/mercury/public/testing/test_dirs/murlibobo.

3.  Test it on lots of architectures.

    Make sure you test that all the programs in the `samples' directory
    work.

4.  Build binary distributions for those architectures.

5.  Copy the gzipped tar files to ~fjh/www_public/mercury, and
    to the turiel ftp site ftp://turiel.cs.mu.oz.au/pub/mercury.
    Email kostis@cs.sunysb.edu (Konstantinos Sagonas) to tell him
    to make copies of it on ftp://ftp.cs.sunysb.edu/pub/XSB/mercury
    respectively.
    The mirror on ftp://ftp.csd.uu.se/pub/Mercury is automated.

6.  Email mercury-announce@cs.mu.oz.au and cross-post announcement to
    comp.lang.misc, comp.lang.prolog, comp.lang.functional, comp.object.logic,
    and for major releases also to comp.compilers and gnu.announce.

7.  Update the Mercury WWW home page (/local/dept/www/mercury/mercury.html).
