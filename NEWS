NEWS since Mercury release 0.8:
-------------------------------

Changes to the Mercury language:
********************************

* We've made a small change to the rule for quantification of lambda
  expressions.  

  The new rule is that all variables in the arguments of lambda
  expressions are treated as locally quantified to that lambda expression.
  For function lambda expressions, variables in the result term
  use the normal quantification rules.  See the "Data-terms" section
  of the "Syntax" chapter of the Mercury language reference manual
  for details.
  
  Previously, the exact quantification rule for lambda expressions was
  not documented, but the compiler would locally quantify variables in
  function return values, and it would only locally quantify variables
  occuring at the top level of an argument term, not those occurring in
  subterms.  Both of these were rather surprising for functional
  programmers.

  It is possible that this change may break some existing code using
  predicate lambda expressions with compound terms as arguments, but we
  expect this to be extremely rare.  If it does occur, the compiler
  will issue a warning about variables having overlapping scopes, and
  the work-around is simple: use a fresh variable for the lambda
  predicate argument and unify it with the compound term in the body of
  the lambda expression.

* The old-style syntax for predicate lambda expressions,
  `lambda([<Args>] is <Det>, <Goal>)', is now officially deprecated.

  Please use the new syntax-style `(pred([<Args>]) is <Det> :- <Goal>)'
  instead.  The compiler still supports the old-style syntax, but
  we plan to eventually drop this support in some future release.

Changes to the Mercury standard library:
****************************************

* We've added a new predicate to the Mercury standard library:
	bag__count_value/3.

* The following predicates have been replaced by functions with
  the same names, and will be removed in a future release.
  The predicate versions were intended for use in programs which needed
  to work in both Prolog and Mercury, but executing Mercury programs using
  Prolog is no longer supported.
	float__ceiling_to_int/2,
	float__floor_to_int/2,
	float__round_to_int/2,
	float__truncate_to_int/2,
	float__abs/2,
	float__max/3,
	float__min/3,
	float__pow/3,
	float__hash/2,
	float__max/1,
	float__min/1,
	float__epsilon/1,
	float__radix/1,
	float__mantissa_digits/1,
	float__min_exponent/1,
	float__max_exponent/1.

* The implementations of `int:>>/2' and `int:<</2' have been changed to define
  the results for negative shift counts and shift counts greater than the
  word size.

  For efficiency, we also provide the functions `int:unchecked_left_shift/2'
  and `int:unchecked_right_shift/2' that, like the previous implementations
  of `int:>>/2' and `int:<</2', do not check for these cases.

New library packages in the Mercury extras distribution:
********************************************************

* We've added support for optional lazy evaluation.

  The extras distribution now includes a new module `lazy',
  which provides support for optional lazy evaluation
  via a type `lazy(T)', with `delay' and `force' operations.
  There's also a `lazy_list' module which uses the `lazy' module.
  See the files in extras/lazy_evaluation for details.

* The extras distribution now includes support for dynamic linking.

  The interface is based on the C functions dlopen(), dlsym(), and co.,
  which are supported by most modern Unix systems.
  See the files in extras/dynamic_linking for details.

Changes to the Mercury implementation:
**************************************

* The Mercury debugger (mdb) now includes support for interactive queries.

  See the "Interactive query commands" subsection of the "Debugger commands"
  section of the "Debugging" chapter of the Mercury User's Guide for details.

* The Mercury debugger (mdb) now optionally supports command-line editing
  and command-line history.

  This support uses the GNU Readline library.  For the source distribution,
  the Mercury configure script will detect whether readline has been
  installed and will only enable the command-line editing and history
  support if readline has been installed.  For the binary distribution,
  if the binary distribution was built with readline, then you will
  need to install GNU readline in order to use the debugger.

  For information on where to obtain GNU Readline, see the INSTALL file.

* We've removed the support for using a Prolog debugger on Mercury programs.

  Now that we have a working Mercury debugger, there's no longer any need to
  use a Prolog debugger for debugging Mercury code.

  Normally we would warn at least one or two releases in advance, if
  any feature is to be removed.  However, in this case

  	- it was an implementation feature rather than a language feature;
	- the cost of maintaining the feature was quite high;
	- the feature was already broken is various ways [one being that it
	  doesn't work with the latest versions of SICStus Prolog, due to
	  those versions removing support for a SICStus Prolog feature
	  (save/1), apparently without any advance notice]; and
	- a simple work-around is available if anything breaks as a result
	  of the feature being removed. 

  In the unlikely event that anyone happened to have any makefiles or
  scripts that depended on the support for using Prolog, they can
  install the latest Mercury distribution and still continue to use the
  Prolog support from Mercury 0.8, just by including the `bin'
  directories for both versions in their PATH, with the more recent one
  first, of course.
